        <h2>Project Description</h2>
        <p>For this project, I am
         to design and create a webapp that would help blind-low vision users understand documents better. My goal
        of this project is to create a software that would convert PDFs, handwritten text, and various images into 
    speech. The primary users for this project is going to BLV communities, but it has the capacity to help elderly people, 
English-as-a-second language ESL speakers, and people who have dyslexia. </p>

        <h2>Why is it fun or educational?</h2>
        <p> I am a firm believer that technology is meant for the 
            greater good of the world. The ability to learn how can 
        leverage the tools to help people have always fasicinated me.  </p>

        <h2>What does success look like? </h2>
        <p>For this project, success will look like 
            the webapp being created and handle inputs of 
        PDFs. Some metrics to think about include
         the accuracy of text-to-speech ratio, understandment of the 
        text through users' perspective, retention rate and referral or
    engagement increase of the software.  </p>    </div>
